            While not yet having any work experience, I am hoping to be hired to gain the responsibility it will teach me to have. I am a student who is patient and can work well with both others or alone. I pay attention to detail and make sure any task given is completed to the best of my ability. I make sure to prioritize and maintain my commitments. Before entering high school, I was a Girl Scout for 9 years which gave me experience both in nature and social aspects. <br>
