            Hi! My name is Sabrina Lee. I am fifteen years old and part of a family of five; including my dog named Daisy. My older brother, Jarrett, is eighteen years old and though in college, still serves as a good role model for me. I am currently in my freshman year at Medfield High School and am looking for a job. <br>

            <div class="a" id= "navy">
            While not yet having any work experience, I am hoping to be hired to gain the responsibility it will teach me to have. I am a student who is patient and can work well with both others or alone. I pay attention to detail and make sure any task given is completed to the best of my ability. I make sure to prioritize and maintain my commitments. Before entering high school, I was a Girl Scout for 9 years which gave me experience both in nature and social aspects. <br>
