<h2 class= "red" id= "me"> My thoughts</h2>
    <p class= "a"> I believe most ratings for both movies and shows are fair. Hands down, ratings need to exist in order for young kids to remain innocent and prevent them from having nightmares. To play it safe, I believe a show or movie having a lower rating is safer, as there is no risk of inappropriate visuals. I am a very skiddish person, and would prefer to avoid any possibilty of having to stay up all night for a bad dream. On the contrary, I do believe there is a flip side. In the reverse, some parents may believe ratings are limiting their children and sometimes that is the case. A scene with a gun or any type of violence or inappropriate language may appear and some parents may freak out while others will believe it was an okay choice to show the movie or show to their children. One very controversial movie is Jaws. Jaws originally had many gruesome scenes. When trimmed down, the movie was able to get a PG rating. However, it was still believed the film should be at least PG-13; as do I. The opening scene consists of teenagers drinking, smoking, and making out; yet the movie was given a PG rating. In this case, I believe movies are too lightly rated. </p>
